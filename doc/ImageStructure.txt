Design consideration about how to structure image data

<Sensor data or storage data>
Any data set directly related to a specific file format or a sensor type.
This structure should be used only to directly store/load data from/to a file, stream or
sensor.
Any computation using the data should be done on image processing data instead of this data
after a translation/mapping process.
Each data set may contain meta data block about the measurement.
Each data set is a single measurement. I = I(t) where t = 0.
If multiple or continuous measurements are to be stored, it will be an array of this
structure.
Each data set should be loaded in a continuous memory block.
The logic to access data is different depending on BIP vs. BSQ vs. BIL.

[BIP] band-interleaved by pixel or pixel interleaved
examples: most of color cameras with RGB mosaics
Physical distance (at the target) between pixels for horizontal and vertical directions are
usually identical.
Data is stored as BAND -> column -> row.
The number of bands is usually limited, up to 3.

[BSQ] band-sequential or band interleaved
examples: cameras with optical filters
Physical distance (at the target) between pixels for horizontal and vertical directions are
usually identical.
Data is stored as column -> row -> BAND.
The number of bands is usually higher than BIP, but still limited.

[BIL] band-interleaved by line or row interleaved
examples: line sensors with a spectral slit and a prism or grading
Physical distance (at the target) between pixels for horizontal and vertical directions are
usually NOT identical.
Data is stored as column -> BAND -> row.
The number of bands is usually higher than BIL, but still limited.

Multi-spectral image data with a few spectral bands are occasionally collected as many
measurements at different times. {I} = {I(t)} where t = {0, ..., N}.
The multiple measurement may be stored in one file, but they should be multiple instances of
this object.
Hyper-spectral image data with many spectral bands are almost always collected as a single
measurement. I = I(t) where t = 0.


<Image processing data>
Any data set for computation in memory or visualization on screens, e.g., bitmap image data.
This structure should not be tied to any sensor and should not contain meta data blocks.
Data could be a single measurement or multiple measurements. I = I(t) where t = {0, ..., N}.
Data is ALWAYS stored as CHANNEL -> pixel (column) -> line (row) -> FRAME.
Channel usually corresponds to the band in BIP sensor data.
Frame usually corresponds to the band in BSQ sensor data or time in movie data.
The number of channels is usually limited (up to 4) and fixed while the number of frames is
usually UNLIMITED.
Physical distance (on the screen) between pixels for horizontal and vertical directions are
(usually) identical.
Up to one frame should be loaded in a continuous memory block, but multiple frames could be
distributed at multiple memory blocks or even at a disk at any given time.

[Mapping] band and time <-> channel and frame
The color bands are channels in RGB bitmap images.
The color bands are frames in planar RGB images. (deprecating?)
The spectral bands are frames in multi- or hyper-spectral images.
Time-sequenced measurement are frames in movie data.
NOTE: Even though color bands are a type of spectral bands for sensors, they are considered
as channels in this structure for visualization purpose.
If a color image is actually treated as a multi-spectral image, then it may be represented
as 3 frames of single-channel image.

Q. What about multiple measurements of multi-spectral images?
It should be reconstructed as an array of structures where frames presents time, so each data
set is designated for each band.
In other words, frames should present bands only if the data is a single-measurement.

depth: number of channels per pixel
width: number of pixel per line
height: number of line per frame
length: number of frames per block
c: position of a channel at given pixel; [0 ~ depth)
x: position of a pixel at given line; [0 ~ width)
y: position of a line at given frame; [0 ~ height)
f: position of a frame at given block; [0 ~ length)
